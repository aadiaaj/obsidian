- Intros
- GenAI usage check-in: How often does everyone use AI and in what cases?
- [Jeremy] What is coding with V.I.B.E.S?
- Documentation is going to take more time
- Comments + Questions


How often do you use AI?
When do you use AI in a technical sense?
How has using AI helped you while learning?
What problems/gaps have you seen when using AI?


**Coding with V.I.B.E.S. Best Practices**
Where the issue can lie when it comes to using AI as new developers/developers in this generation
- Finding issues / ways to optimize is more difficult when using AI
	- example: Jeremy telling me what the AI did versus what he preferred when it came to setting up the routing and the type interface. 
		- i wouldn't note that because i never learned that or had that experience
		- you don't know what you don't know
- Any other scenarios when genAI has limited your understanding? Or couldn't do what you wanted it to?
Steps to take to upskill:
- Spending more time on documentation
- Asking the AI tool what things mean
- personal projects
- utilizing google and stack overflow
- Don't want to say to NOT use AI, because that doesn't mimic real world situations and it's almost inevitable at this point since Ai is literally in google searches nowawads
- But more so use AI to help formulate a plan, create the user stories, review the stories and adjust where necessary, suggest potential solutions, and get as far as you can yourself executing the plan.
- encouraging senior developers to make themselves accessible to the junior devs on their team -- provide guidance, Q+A, advice, best practices, foundational tools, etc
