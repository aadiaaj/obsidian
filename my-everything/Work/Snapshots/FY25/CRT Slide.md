Rebranding Staff Council

Over the past 2 months, I have been working on rebranding Staff Council. It has been a few years since it started, with multiple reorganizations in the meantime, so the climate has almost forced us to shift things around. While doing so I have worked closely with my co-leads and the lead TC to:

1. Lead a retrospective with Staff Council leads to reflect on what went well, what hasn’t went so well, and other observations for FY25
2. Emphasize the efforts on learning soft-skills during AH calls to acknowledge the business acumen necessary in technical roles and to divert from the already abundant technical calls outside of AH calls

I am also working on implementing the following to prepare for FY26, based on feedback from FY25

1. Only recruiting Staff Council members at the beginning of the fiscal year
2. Adding in-depth roles, responsibilities, and expectations to the Staff Council application
3. Increasing the experience minimum for pillar leads to 6+ months
4. Restructuring the agenda of Staff Council meetings and pillar meetings to increase engagement
5. Reconsidering the occurrence of All Hands and PoP surveys
6. Making office champions a more prominent pillar
