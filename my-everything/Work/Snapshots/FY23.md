IH --> AI --> Internet and 5G oT --> IoT 
- Why? We as tech consultants need an opinion 
- Internet + 5G of Things 
	- internet devices: google home, temperature sensors, etc. 
	- Used in SMART factories. Ex.) Maintenance sensors 
	- 5G & IoT working together: ex.) get a notification on a new Target product when driving near one 
- Minimum c___ platform: clous services: google, microsoft, amazon, … 
	- Focus is to use an IoT Microsoft package to manage sensors and we are creating those packages for consultants 
	- TCO is for folks worried about costs of IoT packages 
IoT CTO flow for webapp 
- Client interested in IoT package and wants to know an estimate of the cost of everything 
- Questionnaire/Input: IoT device(s) --> Smart Factory/office --> how many square feet? What sensors are needed? --> how many years => total cost 
- Current status: 5G team has taken a crack @ it – IoT has also, but open to changes 
- 6 important categories for development: client inputs, client outputs, assumptions, UI, technical architecture 
- Current development team: Me, Ryan, and some AC Team 
- Managers: Antoinette and Alex 
- Resources: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/C86xRuAAcSEpwyRQIG1wOl/TCO-Calculator) | [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IxRP_FB2oYOfcJYpQ3bWcPb391H6cJxF/edit#slide=id.g2043c4d454d_5_1369) | [Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSygNjZNAE2euw4Yf1ikXg_b5fE-C-re/edit#gid=940380972) | [Repo](https://dev.azure.com/pwc-us-pt-innovationhub/IoT%20Minimum%20Common%20Platform/_git/IoT-MCP-TCO)
