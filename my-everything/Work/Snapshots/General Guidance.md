Snapshots: 
- What differentiates me on assignments I’m working on? 
- What impact am I making? 
- What differentiates me on assignments I’m working on? 
- What impact am I making? 
- Make sure having a constant conversation with RL (biweekly/monthly) + Project Supervisor
- Is this a good stopping point? 
- Is there more to do on this project, can I get another snapshot or at least a significant portion included in another snapshot. 
- I try to not send snapshots for less than 160 hours 
- snapshots of more than 300 hours are probably too large. 
- You're aiming for 6-12 snapshots a year (see the hour range above)
