**S: Mentoring interns and new hires about coding with vibes and gauging their interest**
M: Have a call with interns to teach them about coding with vibes and then ending it with their feedback on using AI + Having another call with them to discuss best practices and any questions/concerns
A: Attainable to do because their internship ends July 25th
R: GenAI is very prominent in our lives as developers (from junior to senior to architects)
T: Two 30-minute calls in July: 1 as an intro + feedback & 2 for best practices and concerns

recommend 45-minutes, starting at the top of the hour, for extra buffer room 
	- if we end early, encourage taking a break to stretch, grab water, and
participation:
	- definitely 
best practices:
- Steps to take to upskill:
	- personal projects
	- cheat sheet vs no cheat sheet --> no cheat sheet for personal projects
	- challenge yourself: google and stack overflow only

	Finding issues / ways to optimize is more difficult when using AI
	- example: Jeremy telling me what the AI did versus what he preferred when it came to setting up the routing and the type interface. 
		- i wouldn't note that because i never learned that or had that experience
		- you don't know what you don't know
	
	CTA:
	- senior developers should also make themselves accessible to the junior devs on their team for guidance, Q+A, advice
- jeremy advice:
	- use AI for project --> take away AI, now build it
	- how are we bringing in new talent 
	- maintaining existing projects
